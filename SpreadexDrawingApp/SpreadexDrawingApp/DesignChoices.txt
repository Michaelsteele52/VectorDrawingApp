Base Class

I started with a base class for a few reasons:
- Shared concept of co-ordinates
- Wanted a printer that accepted a list of different objects
- Wanted to have a shared print functionality for all Widgets that could be accessed from the base class.
- Checking for positive numbers seemed like something that would be used in all widgets

Static Printer

I didn't feel I needed an instance of a new printer every time I wanted to print out the widget, this felt naturally static.
It is a more a tool that is used to add the heading and lines around the widgets to be printed

Check Number is Positive

This check was what I was most unsure about as it would depend on how this bit of code is tied into the wider program.
But for now it checks if the input is positive and sets it to 0 if not. When visualising the problem, in paint for example, 
I can drag the mouse on a shape, but it will just grow in the other direction, not get infinitely smaller.

Widget Types

I used to Enums for the types, but that is not necessary, it does mean that the setting of the type is compeletely private.

Thank you for the opportunity to do this code test. I had fun writing it for you.
